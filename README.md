Given a dataset of 20 different newspaper folders where each folder contained thousands of files which have text written inside them. I have predicted that the new text file should belong to which newspaper using my own naive bayes algorithm. I have also compared the algorithm by implementing sklearn naive bayes algorithm. The former gave accuracy of 89% while the later gave 91%.
